# Surveying and Preserving the Digital Crime Scene

## **Aim:**
Data recovery from unallocated space, using forensic tools(Autospy) to extract and analyze data.

## **Implementation steps:**

### **1. Copy Files to the Virtual Disk**  
- Open **File Explorer** → Go to the new drive (`C: or D:`), where the folder created in the New Virtual Disk
- Create a new folder (`Autospy`) and copy **images or files** into it.  

### **2. Delete the Files**  
- Select any one or two images → Press **Delete**.  
- Empty the **Recycle Bin** to permanently delete them.
